# The repository of a project in Machine Learning and Data Mining

## Pupose
The goal of this project is to mine comments from facebook pages (newspages) using the Facebook GraphAPI, and do various things with them using Deep Learning frameworks such as Keras, and various Machine Learning methods as well as Natural Language Processing to perform statistics on them.

## Example of possible scope:

* A Long Short Term Memory model to generate texts based on harvested content (i.e., a text generating tool), developed using the Keras framework in python (In development).
* Various statistics on real social media data (In planning).
* Text classification - a tool to distinguish between readerbases of content posted on social media pages (customer segmentation) (In planning).
* Implementation of above in a website using e.g. django. (In planning).

And of course to learn a lot while doing this.
